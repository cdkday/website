Removing the need to deal with CloudFormation's YAML DSL and leveraging CDKs growing library of constructs means AWS users can be more productive, expressive and deliver more valueOn the other side, utilising CDK means still dealing with CloudFormation's quirks. Running into problems like resource limits at the CloudFormation level can be frustrating, and thats before we talk about UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED.Pulumi is a universal infrastructure as code platform that like CDK, allows you to leverage a wide array of familiar programming languages to provision infrastructure across many cloud providers, and recently the ability to consume AWS CDK constructs has been added.In this talk, David & Lee will walk you through how Pulumi's CDK support works, what opportunities are opened up by being able to consume AWS constructs in Pulumi and how Pulumi can set you free of CloudFormation's idiosyncrasies",
